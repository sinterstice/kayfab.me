Hi, I'm Kay! I am a multidisciplinary artist and engineer, with over a decade of experience in full-stack software engineering, in addition to IT experience; and more recently, I have written and directed subversive and genre-bending immersive theater experiences through my production company, [Holy Bone! Productions](https://holybone.zone/). 

My dream is to combine my technical expertise with my loves for performing and for game design to create immersive live experiences which push the boundaries of interactivity.

I am also available for freelance coding work. If you would like to hire me, [drop me a line](/hire-me).
