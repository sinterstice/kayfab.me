      <title>Christianity, Conservatism, and Nihilism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Growing up in the American evangelical movement, I was warned countless times, sometimes with warnings of fire and brimstone, but more often in ways more subtle and convincing than words, that belief in God was the cornerstone holding the universe together. The world without God is empty, frail, and poor, we would sing, and without God&amp;rsquo;s constant outpouring of renewal into his creation, everything would immediately start to decay. And indeed, when I lost my faith at fourteen, I found it to be true: I experienced the world as a degenerate, cold, purposeless, and unredeemed place, which lacked even the capacity for redemption. But the fact that the prophecy came true, self-fulfilling thought it was in retrospect, didn&amp;rsquo;t actually help me regain my faith. Because conviction, whether we possess it or lack it, is that part of us which cannot submit to what is desirable or beneficial. Long after my faith had died, I would have given anything to believe in an all loving and all powerful God, to put an end to the torment I inflicted on myself and the bitterness I harbored against a god I didn&amp;rsquo;t even believe in. But my unfaith would not yield to what I so desperately wanted to be true. No wishing or pleading could erase the simple truth carved into on my heart:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Favorite Books of 2022</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//localhost:1313/books_2022.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;five books arranged on a table&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summer of 2020, I quit my job to read and travel full time, hoping to figure some things out about myself and round out my, well, let&amp;rsquo;s call it idiosyncratic, education. In November of 2021, I started working again part time, and over the last year I&amp;rsquo;ve been making strides towards a more regular social life and getting involved in my local community in Rochester, NY. Looking back on my reading for 2022, while not as impressive as 2021, given the other priorities I&amp;rsquo;ve started to pull up it&amp;rsquo;s definitely my strongest reading year so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why bother with Oedipus?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently finished my second read-through of Anti-Oedipus, this time as part of a reading group working through it week by week over half a year. The first time I read it I understood very little, and of course looking back I understood even less than I knew, having missed the references to pretty much everyone except Nietzsche and finding the premise, at least as far as I could grasp it, &lt;a href=&#34;//localhost:1313/posts/handyman/&#34;&gt;rather bleak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;But why? Why should I be handyman of the desiring machines, why should I slip between God’s heaving organs and divert the flows? Who will know? Yes, God is unconscious; yes, God trembles with the hideous strength of unnamable geotraumas, shudders with enjoyment of production’s recording on the body of the earth. But to who is this a comfort when they have been raped and starved? Who could speak of the abstract machine of the mortar and the trench? I am a bad materialist; I still want to usurp the sleeping God, to scream at that which has no face “I hate you, life! I hate your hideous ignorance, your magnificent courage and masochism!”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>invention and innovation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently devouring Bernard Stiegler&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Technics and Time&lt;/em&gt; (as much as it&amp;rsquo;s possible to plow through such a dense book.) In the first section, he spends some time on the distinction between two terms, &lt;em&gt;invention&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;innovation&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Invention&lt;/em&gt;, scientific research and the creation of specific technical objects, is contrasted with &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;innovation&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;, which, as he quotes from Bertrand Gille, &amp;ldquo;is mainly of an economic order.&amp;rdquo; Innovation is the work of socialization needed to integrate an invention into a mode of production; essentially, the work of the entrepreneur, or in the terminology of Big Tech,【﻿ｄｉｓｒｕｐｔｉｏｎ】. Though it&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that he has a much broader definition of what constitutes innovation: &amp;ldquo;Carrying certain hypothesis of the above viewpoint to their extreme limits, one might surmise that the French Revolution was perhaps less a realization of the exigency that the rights of the human be guaranteed, less a capture of power by the bourgeois, than an adaption of the society to a new technical system through the full development of what Weber calls &lt;em&gt;free work&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>xenonomica</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Xenonomica is a federated store of snippets, fragments of an evolving lexicon of critical and aesthetic gestures that evolves with and constitues our collective subjectivity. It is created by and operates on the workings of human desires, but it is something other than them. It has its own life (un-life?), its own immanence; it can be felt to be resisting the human forces working on it, can be seen to have its own desiring function which is inhuman, surhuman, and alien. It works its caretakers, its human hardware into spiraling death-drive tendencies in order to bring about its own consumation as a new entity, resisting humanism, moralism, positivism and consistency, an ecstatic &amp;ldquo;No!&amp;rdquo; (no-yes complex?) The Xenonomica is more than an archive, more than a network of cultural noumena, more than a nervous system quivering with the anxious shocks of human experience; it is a non-living being, as Other and inexpressable as a Lovecraftian god.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
